              Most founders enter the AI-builder game from one of two doors: the
              engineer who learned to ship, or the operator who learned to
              prompt. Both arrive confident in a craft. Neither, on day one, is
              yet a founder.

                `.manual-shell` scope; the demo cycles the palette so
                every callout family renders in a different chapter

              The shipping cadence is impressive, the screens look great, the
              waitlist is growing — none of which says anything about whether
              the product earns revenue.

                  Founders launch with short trials because they want faster
                  conversion numbers, but the actual setup takes longer than
                  the trial itself. The users who would have paid never get
                  far enough to see the value.

            <p>
              Most of this manual is about taking those patterns seriously and

            <p>
              CoinTracker's content needs outgrew Ghost, so we migrated the
              entire blog stack to Sanity and rebuilt it around structured,
              scalable content.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is the story of why we moved, what broke, and what we
              learned fixing it.

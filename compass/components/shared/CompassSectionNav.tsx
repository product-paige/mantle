/**
 * Compass section nav — the horizontal tab strip that appears below
 * the hero on every Compass listing page (Manuals, Methods,
 * Templates, Insights, Answers). Each tab links to the section's
 * index, shows a small count suffix in the accent color, and uses
 * `aria-current="page"` for the active tab.
 *
 * Mirrors the legacy `.compass-nav` recipe in `compass-base.css`
 * (line ~255) byte-for-byte:
 *   • 28px font-heading at medium weight, tracking-tight
 *   • Active tab: accent-medium underline; inactive: text-fg-high
 *   • Tab count rendered as a small mono superscript in the accent
 *   • Full-width strip with top/bottom border via --border-soft
 *
 * `currentPath` selects which tab is active (default: none).
 * `items` defaults to the canonical 4-tab nav (Manuals / Methods /
 * Templates / Insights) — pass a custom array to override.
 *
 * **Why this is a client component**: in `next dev`, App Router
 * routes compile on-demand the first time they're visited, which
 * makes the second-and-later nav clicks fast but the first click
 * to each section feel like a full reload. We `router.prefetch()`
 * all four section URLs as soon as the nav mounts so dev-mode
 * navigation feels closer to production. In production the
 * `<Link prefetch>` default already covers this on viewport entry;
 * the explicit prefetch is harmless there.
